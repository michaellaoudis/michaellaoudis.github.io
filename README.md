### Welcome to my portfolio website! Here you can gain insight into my background and some of the projects I've been working on.

### This project started as an idea to showcase the subjects I've studied while completing my AAS in Information Security. Throughout the process, I've not only developed technical skills with HTML/CSS/JS, but also refined the CyberSec concepts I've been learning to focus on my passion for web app pentesting.
