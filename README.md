# Overview

Here you can gain insight into my background and some of the things I've been working on.

This project started as an idea to showcase the subjects I've studied while completing my AAS in Information Security. Throughout the process, I've not only developed technical skills with HTML/CSS/JS, but continued to update this website as my portfolio grows over time.

# How I Got Started

My passion for the field of IT began in adolescence when I started using my personal computer as a server to host various online games for my friends and I. At that time, I became fascinated with learning how networking, computer hardware, and software worked together so that I could better provide a seamless experience for my colleagues to enjoy. Through self-studying and tinkering, I quickly became aware of the security risks that threatened my computer being public on the Internet. This is what introduced me to the field of cyber-security, as I wanted to learn how to protect my friends and I from malicious actors.

After completing my AAS degree in Information Security and becoming Security+ certified with CompTIA, my career goals shifted from practicing defensive security to offensive. Reaching into the mind of a malicious hacker to understand how systems and information become comrpomised intrigued me the most. Most recently, I have been practicing hands-on ethical hacking through bug bounties and lab environments on TryHackMe and PortSwigger's Web Security Academy.
